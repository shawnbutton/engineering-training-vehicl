# Legacy Code Kata

This code is legacy code. It's bad. 
So bad, in fact, that we don't think most of it even works.

But that's not our problem. Our problem is we want to make this code cleaner, while preserving existing behaviour.

We have written a set of *characterization tests* that capture current behaviour.
Clean up this code while perserving the behaviour exactly as it is.
